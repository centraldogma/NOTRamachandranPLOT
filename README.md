# NOTRamachandranPLOT
This is an experiment to find insightful patterns among non-Ramachandran torsion angles using the large database of protein structures (presently restricted to PDB files). At the moment the program takes 2 INUTS 1)PDB file URL and 2)A single atomic type(eg. C-alpha) of the PDB file and OUTPUTS the torsion angles(using vector geometry) between all the atoms of the input type.
